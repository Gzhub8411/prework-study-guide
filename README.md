## Usage

Here an example is stated of our Process in web development.
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <title>Panda Fan Site!</title>
    </head>

    <body>
      <!-- Coming soon! -->
    </body>
  </html>

*At the very top, we see the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.

*Next, we see the <html> opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. Inside the <html> tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English). An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.

*Next, we see the <head> opening element. The <head> element contains the metadata for our web application. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.

Inside the <head> element, we can use the following metadata tags:

The <title> element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

The <style> element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.

The <base> element defines the base URL for a webpage.

The<link> element connects an external resource to the HTML document.

The <meta> element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.

* The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.

* The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
